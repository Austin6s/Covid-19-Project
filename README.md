## Covid-19 Data Exploration

### Date created
September 14th, 2021

### Required Software and Packages
Postgres SQL --version 13

### Description
In this project, I used SQL to explore some Covid-19 data; such as deaths and vaccinations by country.

I wasn't looking for anything in particular in this project, but I started by asking a few questions I thought might be insightful. I made two separate SQL scripts in this project; the first one was purely exploratory, and the second one contains four queries I thought were interesting. I used the second script to create a few visualizations in Tableau.

The first visualization shows just some basic world data about total infections, total deaths, and the global death rate. The second visualization is a bar chart of death rates by continent. The third is a map of the infection rate by country. The last visual is a graph comparing the Covid infection rate of the USA to five other randomly selected countries.
